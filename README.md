## ðŸ–± Implementation of Technologies Used

### Spring Security and JWT
- Spring Security and JWT were used for the security of the web application.
- How is it used on the web application?
    - **Initial Setup for the Spring Security and JWT**
    ```xml
    <dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
		<groupId>com.auth0</groupId>
		<artifactId>java-jwt</artifactId>
		<version>3.19.2</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
		<groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>
		<artifactId>jjwt</artifactId>
		<version>0.9.1</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
- **Configuration of Spring Security**
    - Create a SecurityConfiguration class that extends Web SecurityConfigurerAdapter
    - Override two configure() methods with AuthenticationManagerBuilder and HttpSecurity as the parameter.
    - Create a bean for AuthenticationManager, DaoAuthenticationProvider, and PasswordEncoder.
- **Creation of JWT Filter class**
    - This extends the Spring Web Filter OncePerRequestFilter class. For any incoming request this Filter class gets executed. It checks if the request has a valid JWT token. If it has a valid JWT Token then it sets the Authentication in the context, to specify that the current user is authenticated.
    - Create a JWTFilter class that extends OncePerRequestFilter. This filter base class aims to guarantee a single request dispatch, on any servlet container.
    - Create a doFilterInternal method with request, response, and chain as parameters.
- **Creation of JWT utility class**
    - This is the class that helps the application generate JWT token, get username from JWT, and validate the JWT.
    - Set the values for the token validity and secret key.
    - Create methods such as:
        - getUsernameFromToken
        - getIssuedAtDateFromToken
        - getExprirationDateFromToken
        - getClaimFromToken
        - getAllClaimsFromToken
        - isTokenExpired
        - generateToken
        - doGenerateToken
        - validateToken
    - Most of the methods above are just helper functions. The most important methods are the generateToken and validateToken.
- **Creation of AccountDetails class**
    - This is the class that grants authorization and provides getters and setters such as username and password.
    - This class should implement UserDetails interface and implements the methods needed.
- **Creation of AccountDetailsService class**
    - This is the class that creates an account details with username as the parameter.
    - This class should implement UserDetailsService interface and implement the methods needed.
